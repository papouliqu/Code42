Sastantua
=========

"Allosimanius Syneca is a planet noted for ice, snow, mind-hurtling beauty and
stunning cold. The view from the top of the Ice Crystal Pyramids of Sastantua
is widely known for its ability to release the observerâ€™s mind to hitherto
unexperienced horizons of beauty."

A program recreating the Sastantua Pyramids. It was one my first projects at 42.
Compile the c file or run directly the exec (add as first parameter any size you want,
 up to 9)

Cheers.
